# Assignment 1

## Create a valid **HTML5** self-bio using the following tags:
- h1, h2 (and more if you want)
- p (at least 2)
- img (at least 1)
- link (at least 1) with attributes to open on a blank page
- ul or ol (at least 1 list)

Layout and styling at this moment does not matter.

Name your file with your name only and adding .html at the end (i.e., david.html)
